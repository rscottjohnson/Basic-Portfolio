        <p>Hi and welcome.
        <p>My name is Scott Johnson, and I'm currently working 
           as an Operations Controller at DSM Dyneema where I do Finance things
           (MBA, East Carolina University) mixed with Engineer things 
           (BS Industrial Engineering, West Virginia University).  My experience
           in pharmaceutical and textile manufacturing has focused on
           process imprvovement and finance roles, but my long time interest in 
           programming and web development has led me to also code things with 
           the coding bootcamp at the University of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>A West Virginia native (it's not western Virginia, go Mountaineers!), but 
           a North Carolina resident (no shoveling snow here!).  I 
           love traveling with my family, attempting to play basketball, creating 
           things that help people get things done, keeping notes in moleskine 
           notebooks, and our 25lb Maine Coon cat (Max).</p>
